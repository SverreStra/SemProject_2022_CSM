This page is made as a semester project, where the target audience is children between 7-15 years of age.

The page give the oppertunity for kids, teachers, researchers etc.. to either learn more about Robotics, evolution etc.. they also get the oppertunity to buy a guided tour, this page is here to help they who needs to learn more, either reading about it on the page or actually going to the museum itself.

Tools that has been used:
The devoloper has been using Visual Studio Code as the code editor.

There has not been used any JavaScript in this project. Its has only been used HTML and CSS
CSS Grid has been used.
Font Awesome has also been used, here in the form of the Hambuger menu on the Mobile version.

The reason for there not to be used JS in this website is becuase we where only allowed to use HTML and CSS. Hopefully this page will get developt even more when the developer can use JavaScript.

The following challenges was frustrating.
Getting the pages to work on all screen sizes
Getting the Contact form to be responsive
Goal for futher development is to have responsive and different contact form for the different sign up, book tour and contact.

Creating similar "Class" tags is needed if the website is getting futher devolopment.

The developer for this website has been learning some from different Youtube videos about CSS Grid etc..

Kevin Powell on Youtube for CSS Grid. Thanks to him.
